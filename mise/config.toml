# mise global tool configuration
# Managed by dotfiles — do not edit ~/.config/mise/config.toml directly.
# Edit ~/dotfiles/mise/config.toml instead.
#
# Version pinning policy: tools use "latest" intentionally.
# This dotfiles repo prioritizes current tools over reproducibility.
# Reproducible pinned environments are managed per-project via
# .mise.toml files in project roots (mybox will formalize this).
