## Install on a Fresh macOS Setup

These instructions are for when you've already set up your dotfiles. If you want to get started with your own dotfiles you can [find instructions below](#your-own-dotfiles).

### Before you re-install

First, go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?
- Did you update [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to the latest version and ran `mackup backup`?

### Installing macOS cleanly

After going to our checklist above and making sure you backed everything up, we're going to cleanly install macOS with the latest release. Follow [this article](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) to cleanly install the latest macOS.


On fresh installation of MacOS:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

Clone and install dotfiles:

    git clone https://github.com/lcatlett/mydots.git ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles
    cd ~/dotfiles/install
    chmod +wx install.sh
    chmod -R +wx ~/dotfiles/bin
    cp ~/dotfiles/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
    ./install.sh

## Additional steps

1. Install fonts
2. In iterm `Preferences > General > Load preferences from a custom folder or URL` and set it to `~/dotfiles/iterm`
3. Restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
4. Restart your computer to finalize the process
5. Enjoy

    ## Your Own Dotfiles

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

**Please note that the instructions below assume you already have set up Oh My Zsh so make sure to first [install Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#getting-started) before you continue.**

Go through the [`macos`](./macos) files and adjust the settings to your liking. Settings are organizaed into three files for default, extended, and dock configuration. You can find many more settings in [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./install/Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://caskroom.github.io/search) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`.aliases`](./dots/aliases) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`.exports`](./dots/.exports) file. These files get loaded in because the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` setting points to the `.dotfiles` directory. You can adjust the [`.zshrc`](./dots/.zshrc) file to your liking to tweak your Oh My Zsh setup. More info about how to customize Oh My Zsh can be found [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization).

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install Mackup and backup your settings with the commands below. Your settings will be synced to iCloud so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different directory or different storage than iCloud, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#storage).

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.
